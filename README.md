# stuffup

Bash script to use on fresh installation of Kali Linux to stuff it up. I've made this to save some time on installation and to learn some bash. This script will add some tools which I usually add to every fresh install of Kali Linux. Will add more tools as I come across them...

### Prerequisite
Kali Linux

### Usage
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thatdarkw/stuffup/main/stuffup.sh
chmod +x stuffup.sh
./stuffup.sh <directory>
```
